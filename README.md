# Prolog

On Nightal 15th 1494 Gial Engstrand, apprentice investigator under the tutelage of the famous private investigator Sherlock Holmes from Baldur's Gate arrives in Bryn Shander and introduces himself to Sheriff Markham Southwell offering his services as part of his walz, the travels required to complete with multiple inquiries in varying locations in order to be recognized in the investigative community. Based on the recommendation letter from his mentor, and lacking alternatives, Southwell asks Engstrand to investigate the *__case__*.

Gial had met Ezo while he was investigating rumors that a Harengon had saved a group of kids from a Yeti on the outskirts of Bryn Shander. Where he found out that Ezo has been stayin in the town for about a year now, arriving just after the Rime began. He claims he comes from "The Chillbreath Forest" in the Feywild, but hasn't divulged much more than that yet. ...

The Collossi Herja and Ketris arrived in Bryn Shander few days before  the 'week' passed. Ketris and Herja escorted a merchant from some other town, to Bryn Shander, after which we were looking for more work. They noticed that Gial had posted a sign on a message board outside of the Northlook, looking for help regarding an investigation he was conducting. They tore off the tab and showed up at the appointed time to meet with the group.

# Things around Towns


## Dwarven Iron Ore

Hammer 1st 1495. Three dwarves, **Hruna**, **Korux** & **Storn**, approach the crew in Bryn Shander's Northlook Tavern. Their speaker Hruna tells Gial that they have been referred to him by the Sheriff. They tell the crew that they were orgiginally four, transporting iron on slide to town, when they were attacked by Yeti approximately six miles east-north-east of town by Yetis. They offer 350gp for dealing with the Yetis in order to get back their slide (iron ore transport).

The group finds the fourth dwarf. His corpse is partially ripped appart. The attackers, consistent with the Yeti attack, were however interrupted by archers. The tracks lead to the south. The group catches up with those causing the tracks, and it turns out to be goblins about to reach there Ice Bear drawn mobile home carriage with the slide carrying the iron. The group attacks the Goblins killing three or four until the Goblins surrender. During the fighting they learn that the groups female leader is called **Izobai**, and that they intend to bring the iron, *keepers finders*, to **Karkolohk**.

As the group tries to communicate with the Goblins, they are approached by Kythos, the Tiefling. The group takes the sled and with Kythos return to Bryn Shander. When Gial casts Detect Magic during Resting he detects a strong Conjuration source under the clothing of Herja. Kythos seems to have a general authority problem with the authorities, in particular in Ten Towns. The group makes it to Bryn Shander and is paid the 350gp.


## Lycantroph Expedition

Hammer 5th 1495. After having closed the deal with the dwarves in the Shander's Northlook Tavern a bundled up figure enters the tavern and approaches Ezo. She is an elf, ageless qualities, speaks with local dialect. She introduces herself as **Dannika Graysteel**. She tells Ezo that he is probably the right person for her problem as it is about elemental spirits, looking for **Chwinga**. She is offering a `Lantern of Tracking` that is particularily keyd to find elementals. She wants the group to get a Chwinga for her to do some good for the towns. She offers the lantern and 25gp for the job. She can be found in the tavern or at her home which she points out to the group.

The tavern's owner offers some rumors when asked for work.
1. There was a traveller who stayed in the inn and was speaking about an expedition just out of Targos. He heard that in Targos there was a group planning an expdition to look for a Goliath Lycantroph to be heading to Kelvin's Cairn.

## Lycantroph Expedition => Save Gerrit

The group buys and equips an Axe Beak, and heads to **Targos** to look for the expedition. The group meets **Keegan Valryn**, being led there by his sled dog. He is missing his husband **Gerrit**, who was leading a group of adventurers to **Kelvin's Cairn** by way of **Cair-Konig**. **Gerrit** led them there with a sled with six dogs. He offers free lodgin in the tavern and some artwork. They left three days ago. The dog reports (Speak Animals) that it was a large beast next to the mountain. Ezo convinces the dog to lead the group to where it happened. **Keegan** suggests to visit the supplier in **Caer-Konig** as that would have been where **Gerrit** would have picked up supplies.

Hammer 6th 1495. When arriving in **Caer Dineval** Kythos Snowbraid met **Kadroth**, asking for supplies. **Kadroth** accepted his request, however should Snowbraid return before the party kills duergar, Snowbraid is a deadman. While waiting tracks down the source of the `Lantern of Tracking` having lit up and indeed finds **Chwinga** playing tricks on an old woman. Ezo talks to one of them and that one starts following Ezo.

The group arrives in **Caer Konig** being greeted by the drunken town speaker **Trovus** who tells the group when making night at the town tavern that the town had problems with thieves during the last three nights. Color switching magical Northern Light, pair of Goats from the Hook, Line and Sinker, small sack of pearls from Frozenfar Expeditions (which is where the group is supposed to go to get on track with the missing **Gerrit**).

The barkeep **Alie** when asks about suspicions says that she, given the tracks around town, believes the thieves to be dwarves from nearby. Her brother **Cory**, the cook, disagrees with his sister. The investigation of the tracks (*24*) supports the dwarves story (small and heavy, probably wearing armor). The track lead north into the tundra. The tracks investigated are about 24 hours old. They completely disapear after 50ft. Ezo learns that something like an aberant egg is growing in Sol. Sol reveals upon the diagnosis that he has been infected by a **Red Slad** about two months ago. Gial learns that Greater Restoration will fix it.

Hammer 7th 1495. At **Frozenfar Expeditions** the group meets **Jarthra** (Shield Dwarf) and **Atenas** (weathered human). They report that **Gerrit**, with four others bought equipment and went to tavern afterwards. They tell the group the usual route up **Kelvin's Cairn**. The group tracks the expedtion and finds its base camp.

Hammer 7th 1495. After investigating base camp including verifying with the other sled dogs that the expedition went up mountain and did not make it back, the group goes up mountain. The goliaths are telling stories about one of them being raised by **Yeti**. The group climbs, gets overrun by avalanche, finds **Gerrit**, and gets attacked by some kind of mountain lion.

The group chases away the mountain lions and enters the cave. They find the bones of the Goliath **Mokingo Growling Bear Akannathi**, and a `Yeti` with an infant and the missing Halfling whom they seem to be using as a toy for the infant. The `Yeti` backs down wounded and calls out for her mate. As the group leaves the cave with the Halfling **Perilou Fishfinger** the other `Yeti` arrives and is bypassed after it attacks Gial. The group leaves, and as the Halfling tells them that the Tiefling has followed the other path within the cave to the top of the mountain, climbs the mountain. They arrive at the top finding the frozend Tiefling **Astrix** and the remains of s Shield Dwarf, seemingly the camp of another expedition.

**Perilou Fishfinger** tells the group that they had been there in order to allow **Moking Growling Bear Akannathi** to wrestle against a `Werebear`, **Oyaminartok, The Winterwalker**, as the Goliath believe who can beat her in a wrestling match is rewarded with some great gifts.


## Caer-Konig Thieves

Hammer 8th 1495. The group arrives back at the **Northern Light** at evening. The vial found turns out to be a `Potion of Invisibility` (very rare).

Hammer 10th 1495. The group travells north trying to track down the *heavy or armored* thieves. In the evening, when the group makes camp, Kythos tries to spend some more time tracking, and gets ambushed by `Gnolls`. The group runs towards the fight trying to save Kythos.

The group saves Kythos, and Sol gets lost in the blizzard. After resting the group finds tracks and follows them to a **Duregar** fortress built into the mountain itself. Failing to enter they retreat, warn the locals, travel to Bryn Shander, and sell the `Potion of Invisibility`. She might be forom the Arcane Brotherhood, an organization of wizards based in Luskan, but ther accent is more like picked up lately, she originates Longsaddle was a sleepy little hamlet on the Long Road in the Savage Frontier of northwest Faer√ªn. Despite its small size, it was a member of the Lords' Alliance thanks to the presence of the powerful Harpell family of wizards. 


Hammer 14th 1495. While selling and gearing up in Bryn Shander a lot of noice is heard from the north. The town seems to be kinda on edge. There is a mood of fear inside the tavern. Some of the town's malitia enters the tavern, and silence falls over the room. They declare that they are looking for Greta Ulfberg as her name came up in the lottery. "You know the law. Auril's tax needs to be paid". For about a year now all towns in the ten towns have been performing some kind of ritual to appease Auril. In Bryn Shander that is a human sacrifice, this time to happen the next day. With them leaving the fear subsides, seemingly everyone was waiting for the result of the lottery.

Gorung "Guy" Dearg introduces himself. At the end of week a Miss Harpell buys the `Potion of Invisibility`.

Late on the 15th they bind the sacrifice to a stake outside of town, and is gone in the morning. The town is back to calmer after it.

## Goodmead Mead

Rumor from barkeep: I head that in Goodmead the townspeaker Kendrik Railsbarrow was killed by a 9ft tall giant that stole honey mead. He would consider it a personal favor to dael with that in order to make the mead support flow again.

The group travels to Goodmead in order to take care of it. They arrive at Hammer 19th, 15:00. The people of Good Mead seem to have Chultean origin. There is a neveredning buzz at town, sounds like bees, despite it being way to cold. Townfolk tell the group that it was a Verbeak, a large size Giant-kin, smaller than Hill Giant, larger than Ogre. They tell that Seth Mourn, the twon's scout and hunter, had been leavin every morning since the townspeaker was slain, trying to track and warn.

Seth returns blowing the horn, and reports that he found five militia members with caved in heads. The group follows, helped by a fox Ezo bought from Seth who caught it in a trap, the tracks and after resting locates a cave system. Inside the cave they find the Verbeak, a Cave Bear and an Orgre who are in the process of roasing human remains, and kill them. After combat they find Ilxaliam Qican, who had been taken and seemingly been waiting to be killed for food, as the dwarf was. Another Verbeak returns, seemingly the spouse of the one the group had killed. She gets killed, too, and the group rests before searching the place.

A `Pearl of Power` and a `Wand of the War Mage` are found with inside the burial side, and once a fountain cleansing curses is found can be retrieved. For the time being the `Pearl of Power` is given to Ezo, the `Wand of the War Mage` to Ilxaliam.

Hammer 21st 1495. The group returns the mead to Good Mead, and in the morning sells the lifestock recovered from the cave.


## Dougan's Hole

Rumor from youth (in Goodmead): (not regular) Wolves are supposed to be terrorizing the people of Dougan's Hole. Crying Mammoth? Wolves breathing ice?

The people of Dougan's Hold have minor deformities, like mutations. Ezo is sure that it is birth defects, not something ongoing. Might be something like some magical radiation affecting their birth. Indeed *Winter Wolves* terrorize the town demanding tribute and preventing the people from leaving town. The kids of Hilda, Finn (17) and Sil (16) have disappeared and are assumed to have been taken by the wolves. Ezo tracks them. The group gets ambushed by two giant wolves that demand the group help them against their master, a Frost Giant. As the group is not sure they will be able to find those Taken otherwise, they agree to be led there by the wolves.

The group is lead to the Frost Giant home, where the wolves try to instigate them being killed by them and a `Wooly Mammoth`. The awakened `Wooly Mammoth` tells the group that the small people had killed the Frost Giant and taken his axe. It promisses to keep the teens alive until being delivered the axe. The group has no knowledge about where that axe is though. They leave two sets of `Cold Weather Clothing` for the teens and return to town.

Back in the village the group rests at the town speaker's house. Next day is spent with knocking on doors and trying to figure out what happened to the axe, while Ezo investigates the `Twenty Stones of Thruun`. The stones turn out to be old wethered stones roughly arranged in a triangle with a single one in the center. No meaningful markings are found.

The canvasing results in learning that about a year ago a group of adventurers indeed took on the `Frost Giant`, and returned with a giant axe. They were a Dwarf, two Humans, two Goliaths, and a Gnome or Halfling. The have hired a `Finnigan`, a fisherman, to take them to the south, but as the river already was frozen to much, they travelled to the north-east instead trying to reach Easthaven. `Finnigan` had to put them ashore in between Good Mead and Easthaven as the river became not valid for travel in that direction as well. With a lead the group heads towards Easthhaven. Indeed in Good Mead nobody is aware of the adventurers.


## Easthaven

The group arrives in Easthaven, where a sign informs that the town does the sacrifices to Auril. Currently though they are executing a wizard claimed to be a `Red Wizard of Thay` unrelated though. The captain of the guard/milita offers either a `Spell Scroll: Fireball` or a `Bag of Tricks` if the group returns some lost fisherman, who took their boat onto the lake, where in the center fishing by boat is still possible. The expected direction is more eastwards, and there might be `Harpies`. At the Inn the group learns the name of the adventurers having taken the axe, except the Halfling's name likely being fake: Halfling: Wenver Goodtopple, Goliath 1: Rothar Moonlight, Goliath 2: Draka Thundertusk, Dwarf: Karnar Kindbeard, Human 1: Grren Greatmalt, Human 2: Kavell Copperflower. Also the bard there tells a story about the origin of the inn's name, `The White Lady`, and that related to that there is supposed to be a treasure on the bottom of the lake.

At the `Wet Trout Tavern` the group learns that the adventurers likely traveled towards Bryn Shander after their four days stay in Easthaven. They hire a animal handler, `Dorlis Blackfrost`, 3gp per day, and leave in order to look for the missing fishermen.

The group locates an empty row boat. It has four ores, and empty bottles. Tracks lead from where it could have drifted of from towards a cave. They salvage the boat and enter the cave. A frozen stream comes from the cave. The group scales two frozen waterfalls, and encounters a `Frost Giant Skelleton`. After defeating that they encouter the `Sea Hag`(?) `Maud Chiselbones`, and defeat her and a `Will'o'Whisp`. The `Hag` pretty clearly killed the fishermen and was in the process of cooking them. The group still needs to investigate the cavern. `Detect Magic` is active.
